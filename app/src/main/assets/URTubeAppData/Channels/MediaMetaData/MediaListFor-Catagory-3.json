You've come to the right place. Art is an essential life skill that everyone should learn. My channel is dedicated to teaching anyone how to draw using simple step by step techniques that work. I started this channel during the height of my career as an art director working in the video game industry. I have 2 young children that love to draw but my busy work schedule prevented me from teaching them myself. So, I started drawing and uploading videos every day from the back seat of my car. One video led to another and in 2014, Cartooning Club was born. ‚ù§Ô∏è I provide a wide variety of lessons and skill levels for everyone based on your requests.\n\nSubscribe and click that bell notification üîî so you don't miss any of my lesson. \n\nNEW LESSONS 7 DAYS A WEEK @ 6am PST. \n\nShare your art on Instagram @cartooning4kids.\n\nLearn more about me on my OFFICIAL WEBSITE https://www.cartooning4kids.com/\n\nThanks for watching!","mMediaType":7,"mMediaLargeIcon":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJz6dV3d7j5XVNZfw8RmMV3UxkJYVBKFd3rZlA=s800-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo","mMediaSource":{"mMediaSourceId":"UC-biucJWhM8HwjsQ96uoIUw","mSourceName":"","mSourceType":-1,"mSourceUrl":""},"mIsChildDirty":false,"mChildSource":"URTubeAppData/Channels/MediaMetaData/Childs/ChildListFor-Media-CAT-ID-3-MED-ID-6.json"},{"mMediaId":"CAT-ID-3-MED-ID-7","mMediaTitle":"Red Ted Art","mMediaDescription":"WELCOME!
